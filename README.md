This is my fourth and final milestone project for Code instituteâ€™s full-stack web developer diploma. This project is a **Django web application** made with the use of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Python** and utilizing a relational database.

This project is plugged into a **PostgreSQL** database, with **SQlite3** used in the development and was deployed using **Heroku**. **AWS S3 bucket** is used to store static and media files. The **Bootstrap** framework and grid system were used for styling across the site.
